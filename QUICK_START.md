## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Dependency Installation

### Current Status: vcpkg Installation In Progress

The vcpkg package manager is currently installing dependencies in the background.
This takes **30-60 minutes** and is completely normal.

### What's Being Installed
1. **Apache Arrow** (21.0.0) - 15-20 minutes ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS
2. **Parquet** - 5 minutes ‚è≥ PENDING
3. **Eigen3** - 2 minutes ‚è≥ PENDING (hash issue detected)
4. **Dependencies:** OpenSSL, Boost, Thrift, etc. ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS

### Manual Verification

Check installation progress:
```bash
cd C:\vcpkg
.\vcpkg list
```

Expected output after completion:
```
arrow:x64-windows                     21.0.0
parquet:x64-windows                   0
eigen3:x64-windows                    3.4.1
```

---

## üîß Alternative Installation (If vcpkg Fails)

If vcpkg installation is taking too long or failing:

### Option A: Use Precompiled Binaries (Fastest)

Download from:
- Arrow/Parquet: https://github.com/apache/arrow/releases
- Eigen3: https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/releases

Extract to: `C:\Libraries\`

Update `CMakeLists.txt`:
```cmake
set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "C:/Libraries/arrow;C:/Libraries/eigen3")
```

### Option B: Fix Eigen3 Hash Issue

If Eigen3 fails with hash error:

1. Delete cached file:
```bash
del C:\vcpkg\downloads\libeigen-eigen-3.4.1.tar.gz*
```

2. Retry installation:
```bash
cd C:\vcpkg
.\vcpkg install eigen3:x64-windows --clean-after-build
```

3. If still fails, download manually:
```bash
# Download from GitHub mirror instead of GitLab
https://github.com/eigenteam/eigen-git-mirror/archive/3.4.1.tar.gz
```

### Option C: Use Conda (Alternative Package Manager)

```bash
# Install Miniconda
# Then:
conda install -c conda-forge arrow-cpp parquet-cpp eigen
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è Build Instructions (After Dependencies Install)

### Step 1: Verify vcpkg Installation

```bash
cd C:\vcpkg
.\vcpkg list | findstr "arrow parquet eigen"
```

You should see:
```
arrow:x64-windows
parquet:x64-windows
eigen3:x64-windows
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variable

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH = "C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows"
```

**CMD:**
```cmd
set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows
```

### Step 3: Build Project

```bash
cd E:\QESN_MABe_V2
scripts\build.bat
```

**Expected duration:** 5-10 minutes

**Expected output:**
```

### Step 4: Test Executable

```bash

```

If this works, you're ready to train! üéâ

## üìä Training Setup

### Download MABe Dataset

1. Go to: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/MABe-mouse-behavior-detection/data
2. Download:
   - `train.csv` (metadata)
   - `train_tracking/` (parquet files)
   - `train_annotation/` (CSV labels)

3. Extract to: `E:\QESN-MABe\`

### Update Paths

Edit `scripts\train.bat`:

```batch
set "METADATA=E:\QESN-MABe\train.csv"
set "TRACKING=E:\QESN-MABe\train_tracking"
set "ANNOTATION=E:\QESN-MABe\train_annotation"
```

### Start Training

```bash
cd E:\QESN_MABe_V2
scripts\train.bat
```

**Duration:** 12-15 hours (for 100 videos, 30 epochs)

**Progress:**
```
Epoch 1/30
  Training   - Loss: 3.2145, Acc: 12.50%, F1: 0.0823
  Validation - Loss: 3.1872, Acc: 14.32%, F1: 0.0912

Epoch 10/30
  Training   - Loss: 2.1023, Acc: 41.23%, F1: 0.3245
  Validation - Loss: 2.2341, Acc: 38.76%, F1: 0.3012

Epoch 30/30
  Training   - Loss: 1.4382, Acc: 58.71%, F1: 0.4823
  Validation - Loss: 1.6234, Acc: 54.32%, F1: 0.4512
  *** New best model saved! ***
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "CMake Error: Could not find Arrow"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify installation
C:\vcpkg\vcpkg list | findstr arrow

# If missing, install:
cd C:\vcpkg
.\vcpkg install arrow:x64-windows

# Set path:
set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows
```

### Problem: "LNK2001: unresolved external symbol"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Rebuild with clean slate
cd E:\QESN_MABe_V2
rmdir /s /q build
scripts\build.bat
```

### Problem: "std::bad_alloc" during training

**Solution:**
Edit `scripts\train.bat`:
```batch
--batch 16    REM Reduce from 32 to 16
```

### Problem: Accuracy stuck at 2.7%

**Diagnosis:**
This means the model is predicting randomly (1/37 = 2.7%).

**Possible causes:**
1. Dataset not loading correctly
2. Labels not mapped properly
3. Window size incorrect

**Solution:**
Add debug output to `src/io/dataset_loader.cpp`:
```cpp
// After loading first sequence
std::cout << "DEBUG: First keypoint: ("
          << sequences_[0].frames[0].mice[0][0].x << ", "
          << sequences_[0].frames[0].mice[0][0].y << ")" << std::endl;
```

If you see (NaN, NaN), data loading failed.
If you see perfect circle pattern, wrong data is being loaded.

## üìà Expected Results

### Training Metrics
| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Training Accuracy | 55-65% | Much better than random (2.7%) |
| Validation Accuracy | 50-60% | Slight overfitting expected |
| F1-Score (Macro) | 0.40-0.50 | Impacted by rare classes |
| F1-Score (sniff) | 0.65-0.75 | Most frequent class |

### Prediction Distribution
```
sniff:        35% ‚Üê Most frequent behavior
approach:     15%
attack:       12%
rear:          8%
[other 33]:   30% ‚Üê Diverse predictions ‚úì
```

**NOT like V1:**
```
sniff:        99.8% ‚Üê BAD: Predicts same class
[other 36]:    0.2% ‚Üê BROKEN MODEL
```
